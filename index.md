The College of Creative Studies (CCS) Computing Program provides a small, tight-knit community of talented, passionate, self-directed learners in the context of a major research university. Our program provides well-prepared students an accelerated path through the “lower division” curriculum so that they can move quickly into advanced courses offered both in the CCS and the College of Engineering’s CS Department, which is one of the highest ranked CS departments in the nation. Our goal: early involvement of students in research and creative activity.
