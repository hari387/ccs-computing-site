Lia is a third-year CCS Computing and CCS Physics major.  Two years ago, she would never have imagined that she would study abroad summer 2017 at the University of Cambridge in England, be a part of the first UCSB delegation to the 2017 Grace Hopper Conference, or have helped found and organize WomxnHacks in a team of 15 dedicated undergraduates.  For spring quarter 2019, she is looking forward to watching the Computing 2nd years' mid-residency reviews (presentations at the end of 2nd year, like PhD advancements but less formal and by CCS Computing undergrads), and continuing her microwave spectroscopy algorithms research in Professor Dave Patterson's [AMO Physics lab](pattersongroup.physics.ucsb.edu).  This summer, she will be researching quantum computing in the inaugural class of the QURIP REU at IBM and Princeton.  She enjoys being an awful cook and playing unconventional simulation games with friends.
