Carly is a fourth-year CCS Computing major and enrolled in the BS/MS program. She is very involved in the Engineering and CCS community as the Computing Representative for the CCS Student council, the former CCS Dorm RA, and as the Treasurer for the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). SWE is particularly important to her and is always looking for more engineers to recruit and have participate in the volunteer work, professional development, and fun they get up to. During the summer of 2017 she worked for the Microsoft Payments Team, helping develop new testing tools for the e-transaction infrastructure. This coming summer she will return to Microsoft, and work on the One Drive Security Team. Carly is also a tutor for lower division CS classes at UCSB, and conducts research with Koc Lab, a cryptography and cyber-physical security lab at UCSB.
