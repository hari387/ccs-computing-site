quarter: Fall, Winter
---


This course is required for all freshmen (first-year) and lower division CCS Computing majors.

Students taking this course will have an opportunity to build a piece of software of their own design, guided by the instructor, and supported by the community of fellow students.

It is a hands-on project and assignment-based course where students will gain strong practical and technical skills in various programming languages including C, C++, and Java, UNIX/Linux: shell, tools, utilities and programming environments, user interfaces, and software engineering principles.

The course is open to all CCS students who need additional training and practical insight that is needed to take upper division Computing Courses.

This is a 4 units credit course. Units awarded will be based upon attendance, general homework assignments, and individual projects. Instruction and hands on lab work will be 100% in the classroom, where students are expected to work on their own laptop computers. If the student does not own a computer he/she should check with the instructor for alternative arrangements.

This course roughly corresponds to CMPSC 48 in the College of Engineering Computing curriculum.
